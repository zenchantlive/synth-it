Build API-first for $ARGUMENTS endpoint:
1. Define OpenAPI 3.0 specification with request/response schemas
2. Create mock implementations and example responses
3. Write integration tests covering all endpoints and error cases
4. Implement actual endpoint handlers
5. Validate implementation against OpenAPI specification
6. Generate TypeScript client types for frontend
7. Test with Postman/curl and document usage examples
Focus on API contracts and testing before implementation details.
